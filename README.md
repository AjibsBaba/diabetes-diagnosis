<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

This is my first Data Science project deployed on the web. It is a supervised learning study that leverages an ensemble
method that combines different classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting,
KNeighbours, Decision tree, and SVC. The Major goal of this study was to create a web-based interface to run inference
on a machine learning model. The Web application developed with the flask framework helps to predict if a person has
Diabetes mellitus or not via a web-based form.
