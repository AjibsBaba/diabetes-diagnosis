<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is my first ML project deployed on web. it is a supervised learning model, I created an ensemble method that made use of about five models from which i picked the one with the highest frequency which is the Gradient Boosting algorithm after some hypermeter tuning i was able to get an accuracy of 82% which is because i was unable to gather a big dataset on diabetes

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
